Conventional commit messages are structured commit messages that follow a specific format to convey information about the changes made in a commit. They typically consist of a type, optional scope, and a message. Here are some common types of conventional commit messages:

1. **feat**: Denotes a new feature added to the codebase.
2. **fix**: Indicates a bug fix.
3. **docs**: Refers to changes or additions to documentation.
4. **style**: Covers code style changes, such as formatting, indentation, or whitespace.
5. **refactor**: Denotes code refactoring, i.e., changes that don't add new features or fix bugs but improve the code structure.
6. **test**: Indicates additions or modifications to tests.
7. **chore**: Includes changes to the build process, project configuration, or other maintenance tasks.
8. **perf**: Denotes performance improvements.
9. **ci**: Refers to changes to the continuous integration (CI) pipeline or configuration.
10. **revert**: Indicates that the commit reverts a previous commit.

Each of these types helps in quickly understanding the nature of the changes introduced by a commit, facilitating collaboration and tracking of changes in a project.
